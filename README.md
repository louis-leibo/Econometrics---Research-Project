# Econometrics: Research-Project

Mental Health Costs of Covid Lockdown

April - May 2023

This project is part of an Econometrics module taken during my studies at the London School of Economics. 

I first replicate and then extend results in the paper “Mental Health Costs of Lockdowns: Evidence from Age‐Specific Curfews in Turkey,” American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, April 2022, 320‐343. 

This is a study on the impact of the lockdown

Turkey imposed Covid lockdowns on individuals over the age of 65.  This study evaluates the impact of these lockdowns on mental health outcomes. 

My final report describes the research question and the research design, presents  and discuss results showing that lockdowns affected mobility and mental health, presents some evidence for the validity of the RD exercise, presents the assumptions of and the results from the IV model and discuss the implications of the results.
